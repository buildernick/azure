# Examples
- Always look for examples in the /src/examples folder before making anything

# Design System
- Use the Fluent Design System and themeing whenever possible.
- Fluent design system documentation is at: https://react.fluentui.dev/?path=/docs/concepts-introduction--docs

# Themeing
- Everything should use FluentThemeProviders
- It is defined in ThemeProvider.tsx
- Use WebDarkTheme and WebLightTheme from Fluent for all themeing
- When creating new pages or components always give them light and dark mode ability.  For new pages, build a Dark/Light Mode toggle at the top of the page. There's an example on the /myapps page
